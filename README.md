# ActuallyUsefulWebGLTemplate
An actually useful WebGL template!

Settings:
- Optimize for pixel art (true/false) makes sure the rendered image remains sharp
- Preserve aspect ratio (true/false) locks aspect ratio and letterboxes game window
- Minimum / maximum aspect ratios (width:height) letterbox game window when out of aspect range (preserve aspect must be off)
- Loading bar colour (#??????) changes the colour of the loading bar
- Custom logo (png) file which you can change out for whatever you want, replaces the logo above the loading bar

Recommendations:
- Set the loading bar colour to #ffffff, otherwise you may not see it at first
- Enable "Run in background" in the Unity Player settings; otherwise, when you click outside the game, audio may pause and the screen might go grey
- This is designed to work perfectly with itch.io; if uploading there, enable itch.io's fullscreen button
